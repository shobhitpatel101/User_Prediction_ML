User Prediction

It is django framework based python NPL technique.

Based on chat history of user, this model can predict that present user is valide or not.

Trained on the whatapp data for prediction of user who is chatting.

I have tested this model on various chat_record generated by whatsapp. this model is tested on 0.2 test and 0.8 training ratio.
with naive bayes:80%+ accurate
with nural network:82%+ accurate

*accuracy also depend on size and quality of data.

How to generate whatapp chat .txt file ->goto whatapp app

->Chats
